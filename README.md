# PGN's Rust Engine

This is a Game Engine based on principles in the books ["Game Programming Patterns" by Robert Nystrom](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) and ["Game Engine Architecture" by Jason Gregory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E3Q9uDai5RAA4WQRD6OyvzrrqwHJNOxH/view?usp=drive_link).

## Building and running

We use `cargo` to build and run the application.

For quick compiler runs you can use the following command:

```bash
cargo check
```

To build a debug executable, run:

```bash
cargo build
```

To run the debug executable, run:

```bash

To build and run a release executable, run:

```bash
cargo run --release
```
